\section*{Current Week Research Objectives}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em]
    \item Read p155 Open Quantum Systems textbook. 
    \item Write down by hand the Lindblad Master Equation for:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Spontaneous Emission Jump Operator
        \item QHO Jump Operator
        \item Both Jump Operators acting simultaneously.
    \end{itemize}
    For each scenario, ensure that the Trace of the Liouvillian is $0$. 
    \item Consider units for all results - if you're using natural units (omega = 1), then adjust everything accordingly. E.g. time is in units of seconds/omega.
    \item Refine current results.
    \item Collect further results.
    \item For each result, understand and be able to explain the results. 
\end{itemize}
