\section{Introduction} \label{intro}
% Intro to JCM and light description
The quantum description of light-matter interaction can be modelled by a Two-Level System (TLS) interacting with a Quantum Harmonic Oscillator (QHO). In 1963, Edwin Jaynes and Fred Cummings set out to model a single atom interacting with one mode of a quantized electromagnetic field within an optical cavity using the TLS-QHO model under the Rotating Wave Approximation (RWA) (see section \ref{JCM_apps} for definition) \cite{Context1963-JC_Original}. As such, they formulated the Jaynes-Cummings Model (JCM), which remains one of the simplest and most important models of light-matter interaction. Later in 1993, Herbert Walther experimentally verified the JCM, proving its importance within the field of cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (cQED). \cite{Context1993-JC_Verification}.

Presently the JCM, and thus the TLS-QHO model, has been extended to other various areas of research in Physics, including circuit QED \cite{Context2018-Supercond_qubit}, tunnelling phenomena in photonic crystals \cite{Context2012-Tunneling_photons} and trapped ion physics \cite{Context1992-Trapped_ions}. On the other hand, the simplicity of the model is also limiting. The model fails in certain scenarios, such as in the ultra-strong coupling regime in cQED, in systems with more than one TLS or multiple modes of the QHO, and when the RWA is no longer valid \cite{General2024-JC_overview}. The Quantum Rabi Model provides a solution to the RWA problem by including the terms originally ignored by RWA \cite{General2024-JC_overview}. The Dicke Model generalises both the JCM and Rabi Model by allowing for more than one TLS or/and QHO, and by not employing the RWA \cite{General2024-JC_overview}. As we shall see, however, these models are far more complex and usually require computational solutions, whereas the JCM is solvable analytically. 
% Intro and importance of QResources

While more complex models exist, the analytical solvability of the JCM makes it a valuable tool for gaining further insights into light-matter interaction. In particular, understanding how quantum resources manifest within this model provides a foundation for exploring more advanced quantum phenomena. This leads to the study of two key quantum resources: Entanglement and Coherence. Entanglement is a basis-independent measure of how much quantum correlation exists between subsystems of a composite system, indicating how much the system's state deviates from being a separable (product) state \cite{Entanglement2009-Definition}. In a similar vein, coherence is a basis-\textit{dependent} measure, describing the ability of a system to maintain its quantum superposition, and quantifying how well quantum states preserve phase relationships between different basis states \cite{Coherence2017-Colloquium}. Both measures play essential roles in quantum communication and quantum computation, amongst other fields.
% QResources in TLS-QHO etc. 

As quantum technologies progress, achieving precise control over quantum states becomes increasingly important for practical applications. In the context of the TLS-QHO model, entanglement and coherence are key resources that enable both theoretical exploration and experimental control of the system. Entanglement in the TLS-QHO naturally arises from the coupling of the TLS and QHO \cite{Entanglement2009-REE_VNapplied}. Coherence, on the other hand, directly impacts the stability and controllability of the system \cite{Coherence2020-JCMapplied}.  By harnessing these quantum resources, the TLS-QHO model provides a versatile framework for studying and developing future quantum technologies. Given its well-established analytical techniques, the JCM provides an ideal foundation for investigating Quantum Resources in the general TLS-QHO model.  \\
\\
In this review, we investigate the toy-model of the TLS-QHO system through the lens of the JCM, the two Quantum resources of Entanglement and Coherence, and how we may use these resources in our TLS-QHO system. We begin by discussing the history, theoretical aspects, applications, and limitations of the TLS-QHO model in section \ref{sec_TLS-QHO}. We then explore the theoretical applications of entanglement and coherence in section \ref{sec_QRes}. We we examine how Quantum Resources can be applied to the TLS-QHO model in section \ref{sec_QRes_app}, and conclude our findings in section \ref{sec_Conclusion}.

\section{The Jaynes-Cummings Model} \label{sec_TLS-QHO}

\subsection{Introduction and Historical Background} \label{subsec_history}

% Brief history of Quantum mechanics
In 1901, Max Planck introduced the idea of energy quantisation in `packets' of $h\nu$ to explain the energy density of Blackbody Radiation \cite{Context1901-Planck}. In 1905, Albert Einstein famously expanded on this idea in the seminal set of papers named \textit{Annus Mirabilis} \cite{Context1905-Einstein}. In the context of the Photoelectric Effect, Einstein proposed that light is composed of discrete packets of energy, which he labelled as `Quanta'. From this point on, Quantum Theory was beginning to gain traction, and in 1924 Louis de Broglie introduced the idea that particles could exhibit both wave-like and matter-like properties \cite{Context1924-DeBroglie}. This was a pivotal moment in the development of Quantum Theory. Theoretical research was greatly accelerated to develop the field with key figures, such as Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrödinger, pushing the boundaries and testing untouched waters. \\
\\
% Rabi TLS-QHO leading to JC
Isidor Rabi was one of the first physicists to develop the theoretical framework of Quantum light-matter interaction by looking at a single Two-Level System (TLS) coupled to a Quantum Harmonic Oscillator (QHO) \cite{Context1936-Rabi}. A TLS refers to any quantum system with two distinct eigenstates; in the context of the model of light-matter interaction, it refers to an atom with ground and excited energy levels. The QHO refers to a system whose energy levels are quantised; in this context, it refers to a quantised electromagnetic field. As we shall later discuss, Rabi's model, whilst a fairly general model of light-matter, is difficult to analytically solve and often requires computational methods. It remained one of the only reputable models of the TLS-QHO until nearly 30 years later, when in 1963 Edwin Thompson Jaynes and Fred Cummings developed the famous Jaynes-Cummings Model (JCM) of the TLS-QHO whilst studying the field of Quantum Optics \cite{Context1963-JC_Original}.

% JCM and theoretical background

The two physicists set out to clarify the relationship between quantum theory of radiation and the semi-classical theory, and to apply these results to a study of the amplitude and frequency stability of a molecular beam maser. In doing so, they produced a Hamiltonian $H$ (which describes the unitary dynamics of the TLS-QHO model, according to the Schrödinger Equation) composed of three parts \cite{Hamiltonian2012-JC_Friction}: (i) The TLS contribution $H_{TLS}$; (ii) the QHO  contribution $H_{QHO}$; and (iii) The interaction contribution $H_{int}$, which describes the coupling between between the TLS and QHO. According to \cite{General2024-JCM_relevance}, the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) Hamiltonian may be written as

\begin{equation}
    \hat{H} = \hat{H}_{TLS} + \hat{H}_{QHO} + \hat{H}_{int}, 
\end{equation} \label{JC_H}
where 
\begin{align*}
    \begin{aligned}
        \hat{H}_{TLS} &\equiv \frac{\hbar\omega_a}{2}\hat{\sigma}_z \\
        \hat{H}_{QHO} &\equiv \hbar\omega_ca^\dagger a \\
        \hat{H}_{int} &\equiv \hbar g(a\hat{\sigma}_{eg} + a^\dagger\hat{\sigma}_{ge})
    \end{aligned}
\end{align*}

In equation \eqref{JC_H}, $\omega_a$ is the excitation frequency of the TLS, $\omega_c$ is excitation frequency of the QHO, $\sigma_z$ is the Pauli spin operator, $\sigma_{eg}$ and $\sigma_{ge}$ are the respective excitation and de-excitation operators that act on the TLS, $a^\dagger$ and $a$ are the respective creation and annihilation operators that act on the QHO, and $g$ is the coupling strength constant. 

One of the most striking predictions that Jaynes and Cummings made was the presence of Rabi oscillations, which is the periodic exchange of energy between the QHO and the TLS, causing the TLS to oscillate between its two states; this oscillation frequency is known as the Rabi Frequency \cite{Context_-Rabi_oscillations}. 

At the time, however, the technological capabilities required to experimentally verify the JCM and its predictions were not yet available. Despite this, the model garnered support from the physics community, and from the 1960s to the 1980s, theoretical work was done to build upon and extend the foundational framework laid by Jaynes and Cummings \cite{Context1965-TheoreticalJCM, Context1980-TheoreticalJCM, Context1984-TheoreticalJCM}. It wasn't until 1993 that the JCM was experimentally verified by Herbert Walther in the field of cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (cQED) \cite{Context1993-JC_Verification}. Walther injected Rydberg atoms into a superconducting cavity (a `Maser') to study non-classical radiation, mimicking the single TLS, single QHO setup of the JCM. He measured the probability of finding the Rydberg atom in the upper maser level after passing through the cavity, and found that the predictions of the JCM almost exactly matched experimental observations. Furthermore, Rabi oscillations were detected.\\
\\
What began as a quantitative description of the maser in Quantum Optics has now developed into a key model of understanding the intimate relationship between light and matter. Thus from this point onwards, the JCM came to be one of the most successful models of TLS-QHO systems; its success can be attributed to its analytical simplicity and the accuracy of its predictions. This foundational model has found numerous applications in a wide variety of fields, which we shall now study in detail.

\subsection{Applications} \label{JCM_apps}

One of the greatest strengths of the JCM is in its simplicity. This simplicity can be attributed in part due to the Rotating Wave Approximation (RWA). The RWA neglects counter-rotating terms and primarily holds in the strong-coupling (SC) and weak-coupling (WC) regimes, thus greatly simplifying $H_{int}$ to the form we see in equation \eqref{JC_H} \cite{General2010_USC_failure}. As a result,  the JCM finds a wide range of applications, particularly in areas where such simplifications are advantageous.

\subsubsection{Cavity QED} \label{subsubsec_cQED}


%%%% INSERT HERE IMG OF CQED

One prominent application of the JCM is in cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED).The JCM was experimentally verified in the context of cQED, and it continues to be used today to advance this field. cQED describes the interaction between atoms and the quantized electromagnetic field inside a cavity, and allows physicists to gain insight into the radiative properties of atoms \cite{General2024-JC_overview}.\\
\\
In 1995, C.K. Law and J. H. Eberly presented a cQED interaction that forces the ground state of the cavity mode to evolve into an arbitrary quantum state \cite{Context1996-CQED_JCM}. They introduce this interaction by proposing a new approach to control the quantum states of a cavity field: manipulate the quantum states of the atom during the interaction process, rather than before the interaction. Notably, they model their system using a unitarily evolved JC Hamiltonian, and extend the model by injecting time-dependency into the coupling constant $g$ in \eqref{JC_H}.\\
\\
In 2004, Amitabh Joshi and Min Xiao studied non-linear transient effects for a coherent TLS entering a cavity \cite{QResJCm2004-cQED_coherence}. They find that the effects are due to the TLS in the cavity undergoing one-photon transition in a coherent, ideal cavity field. Moreover, controlling the coherence of the atom is shown to produce two notable scenarios: (i) The outgoing atom has positive inversion for even and odd modes of the cavity; (ii) The coherent cavity is depleted due to its mode and dependent on the coherence of the incident atom. This paper uses the exact JC Hamiltonian in \eqref{JC_H} to model the system, further highlighting the JCM's ability to simplify complex systems whilst enabling fine-grain control of the quantum system. Interestingly, the authors' focus is on using the coherence as a resource to modify quantum states and achieve outcomes otherwise unattainable, a subject we shall explore later in section \ref{sec_QRes_app}.\\
\\
In 2012, Yu-Li Dong et al. investigated binary transmission (the process of sending information using two distinct states, typically 0 or 1) in two coupled cavities, each containing a Three-Level Atom \cite{Context2012-CQED_JCM}. They adiabatically eliminate the intermediate state of the Three-Level Atom, allowing it to be modelled by a TLS, thus enabling each TLS-QHO cavity to be described by the JCM. They explicitly mention that the JCM provides simple analytical solutions due to the Hamiltonian being exactly diagonalizable, which enables them to focus on the binary transmission itself. In particular, they compare the scheme using JCM analysis to one that uses the Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model (JCHM), a model which extends the JCM to multiple TLS, multiple mode QHOs and facilitates the study of many-body quantum systems \cite{Context2007-JCH_1,Context2006-JCH_2,Context2006-JCH_3}. In contrast to the JCM's coupling strength $g$, if we maintain the strong coupling regime, the two-photon coupling of the JCHM $\lambda\approx0.1g$. The quantum transfer of information in the JCHM is mentioned to be $5$ times slower than the JCM due to the weaker coupling in the JCHM. On the other hand, the JCHM allows for a significantly larger propagation distance compared to the JCM, thanks to the long lifetime of metastable states. This extended distance is a result of the slower dynamics in the JCHM, which enables more efficient transfer over longer distances. While the JCM remains a powerful tool for analysing binary transmission in cQED, the JCHM's extension to multiple TLS and longer propagation distances makes it a valuable model for more complex, many-body systems. This paper underscores the versatility of the JCM, which, despite its limitations, continues to play a key role in advancing the study of quantum information transmission in cavity QED.\\
\\
In the present day, the JCM still finds continued use in cQED, as demonstrated by recent studies exploring its applicability in modern quantum frameworks. For example, a 2024 study by Liu and Huang explores the quantum phase transition of the JCM in a cavity QED system \cite{Context2024-CQED_JCM}. The authors propose a method for achieving an effective deep-strong coupling regime in a two-level system coupled to a single-mode cavity field. By modulating the atomic transition frequency of a TLS in a quantum Rabi model \cite{Context1936-Rabi}, they demonstrate how the effective coupling strength can be enhanced while still preserving the validity of the JCM. The ability to engineer quantum phases in this setup highlights the JCM’s ongoing relevance in modern cavity QED research, particularly in strong and deep-strong coupling regimes. Similarly, a 2025 study by Danilo Cius investigates the unitary evolution of the JCM under fractional-time dynamics, extending its formulation using a fractional-time Schrödinger equation \cite{Context2025-CQED_JCM}. Cius highlights how fractional calculus modifies key quantum effects in cQED, such as Rabi oscillations and atomic population inversion, while maintaining a unitary description of the system. By employing a time-dependent Dyson map, the study ensures that the JCM remains analytically solvable even in this modified framework. The paper confirms that entanglement between the atom and field remains strongly dependent on the fractional-time parameter, demonstrating how the JCM continues to serve as a valuable tool in advancing our understanding of quantum coherence and cavity field interactions.

\subsubsection{Circuit QED}


%%%%%^% INSERT CIRCUIT QED IMG

Another modern, prominent field of physics which sees extensive use of the JCM is circuit QED. The TLS is modelled by a superconducting circuit made to mimick artificial atoms. The QHO is modelled by a transmission line that forms a microwave cavity. Thus, circuit QED is analogous to cQED, instead using an artificial atom  (rather than a real atom) which is then coupled to the cavity. \\
\\
In 2004, Alexandre Blais et al. proposed using superconducting circuits with transmission line resonators to achieve strong coupling in circuit QED, improving qubit lifetimes \cite{Context2004-CQED_JCM}. They begin by summarising the field of cQED before proposing their methodology. The authors notably mention the JCM in their review of cQED, stating that the atomic transition frequency $\omega_1$, cavity resonance frequency $\omega_2$ and coupling strength $g$ from \eqref{JC_H} are key parameters in describing circuit QED systems. Furthermore, during their proposition, their Hamiltonian reduces to the JC Hamiltonian at the charge degeneracy point by neglecting both rapidly oscillating terms and damping. The paper makes it clear that the JCM's strength is in simplifying the system, and allows us to understand the TLS-QHO interaction at its most fundamental level. \\

A 2013 paper by Sebastian Schmidt and Jens Koch summarises some proposals, phenomena, and experiments which use the JCM and JCHM within circuit QED \cite{Context2013-CircuitQED}. One particular phenomenon that this paper addresses is Photon blockade, a repulsion between photons inside a resonator which may be realised by a TLS-QHO model such as the JCM. The authors state that when a weak coherent drive is in resonance with the lowest transition mode of the TLS, the cavity may only be populated by one photon due to the photon blockade repulsion effect. This phenomenon has been observed experimentally in heterodyne transmission, resonance fluorescence spectra and photon statistics in linear response. The paper's conclusion reiterates a clear trend that we see throughout this review: in order to build an understanding of systems we need a simple model which can provide clear, reliable predictions. The JCM succeeds yet again in providing such understanding and reliability.\\
\\
As with cQED, the JCM again finds relevant use in circuit QED in the present. A 2024 study by Medina-Dozal et al. explores the spectral response of a non-linear JCM in the strong-dispersive regime of circuit QED \cite{Context2024-CircuitQED}. The authors extend the standard JCM by introducing non-linear deformed field operators, leading to an intensity-dependent coupling that affects the system’s spectral features. By deriving analytical expressions for the system’s time-dependent spectral response, the study identifies asymmetries in the spectral structure that deviate from the traditional vacuum Rabi splitting. These spectral modifications provide insights into the effects of non-linearity in superconducting quantum circuits, linking the non-linear JCM to experimentally observed features in circuit QED systems. This work further reinforces the JCM as a foundational model for understanding light-matter interactions in superconducting qubits. However, the standard JCM fails to accurately describe the system in certain regimes, particularly when non-linear effects become significant, necessitating the use of the non-linear JCM. This will be further explored in Section \ref{subsec_limitations}, where we discuss how the nonlinear JCM addresses these limitations in circuit QED systems.

\subsubsection{Alternative Systems}

Whilst the JCM has proven itself as a tractable model for describing light-matter interaction in Quantum Electrodynamical systems, physicists have also used it to model various other physical systems.\\
\\
One particular use of the JCM is found when looking at Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centres, point defects in diamond lattices whereby a nitrogen atom replaces a carbon atom adjacent to a vacant lattice site \cite{General2024-JC_overview}. In a 2009 paper, Paul E. Barclay et al. study the interference phenomena in a system where a diamond nanocrystal containing NV centres is coupled to a microdisk cavity \cite{Context2009-Alt_NVcentres}. In this case, the TLS is represented by the NV centre's single dipole transition; the QHO is the microdisk cavity. Barclay models the system as a cQED system, and explicitly uses the JC Hamiltonian to derive the density matrix equation of motion for the total system. The density matrix is then used to analyse the time evolution of the system's operators, providing detailed characterisation of the interference between the radiation emitted by the NV centre and the microdisk cavity. The JCM framework enables the calculation of the optical spectra and the study of phenomena such as Fano resonances, which arise due to the interference between the direct dipole radiation and the indirect radiation mediated by the cavity mode. This approach proves to be useful in understanding the fundamental light-matter interactions in solid-state cQED systems and highlights the potential of using NV centres in quantum information processing applications. 

The findings of this paper have been used as recently as 2024 in a conference by Xingrui Cheng et al. discussing using NV centres and GaN micro-lenses to increase fluorescent light collection \cite{Context2024_NVcentre_conference}. In the same year, Marc R. Bourgeois et al. released an annual review of  spectroscopy in nanoscopic cavities, where they note that dielectric cavities such as photonic crystals in Barclay's study may be seen as resonators for light with high quality factors \cite{Context2024_NVcentre_review}. Bourgeois states that, due to the crystals being able to trap light in the cavity for long times (around 100 ns), they are good for controlling and modifying the electromagnetic local density of states (EMDLOS).\\
\\
%%%%%^% INSERT NV CENTRE IMG

We find another application of the JCM within ferromagnet-qubit systems \cite{General2024-JC_overview}. An anisotropic ferromagnet may contain magnons, which are a collection of spin excitations of magnets. When the ferromagnet is coupled to a single spin qubit, the total system may be treated as a TLS-QHO. When there is no anisotropy, the JCM is sufficient to model the system. A 2021 study by Ida C. Skogvoll et al. demonstrates that a magnon-spin qubit ensemble can be effectively described using the JC Hamiltonian, provided that the RWA holds. In this system, a single magnon mode acts as a single-mode of a QHO, coupling to multiple spin qubits, which serve as TLSs. The study highlights a key advantage this system: the ability to simultaneously excite multiple qubits using a single squeezed magnon mode, enabling the generation of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, which are crucial to quantum error correction protocols, such as Shor's error correction protocol. The protocol encodes one logical qubit into nine physical qubits, requiring entangled GHZ-like states for efficient error detection and correction. Skogvoll shows that the magnon-qubit ensemble offers a robust way to implement GHZ states, making it a strong candidate for quantum computing and quantum key distribution protocols.

However, whilst the JCM provides a useful approximation in this system, its validity breaks down in the presence of anisotropy. This anisotropy leads to counter-rotating terms which the JCM fails to account for under RWA. The Quantum Rabi Model (QRM), on the other hand, includes these counter-rotating terms, and provides a more accurate description of the system dynamics. Skogvoll explicitly highlights that as anisotropy increases, deviations from the JCM become significant, requiring a transition to the QRM to fully capture the system's behaviour. This suggests that, although the JCM remains a powerful tool in many cases, its limitations become apparent in high-coupling and anisotropic regimes, a topic that will be explored in the next section.

\subsection{Limitations and Open Problems} \label{subsec_limitations}

We have seen numerous applications of the JCM within different fields of physics, and to this day, the JCM remains one of the most widely used and easily solvable models of a TLS-QHO system. However, its applicability is restricted by several inherent approximations. \\
\\
One of the main assumptions of the JCM is the simplification of having a single TLS coupled to a single discrete mode of a QHO. While this is effective in many scenarios, it fails to capture more complex interactions that arise in multi-TLS or multi-mode systems \cite{General2024-JC_overview}.

Another approximations of the JCM is the RWA. As previously mentioned, the RWA neglects counter-rotating terms and holds primarily in the SC and WC regimes. In the context of, for example, cQED, the RWA is:

\begin{equation}
    \boldsymbol{\hat{d}}\cdot\boldsymbol{\hat{E}} \propto (\hat{\sigma}_{eg} + \hat{\sigma}_{ge})(a + a^\dagger)\approx (a\hat{\sigma}_{eg} + a^\dagger\hat{\sigma}_{ge}), \label{RWA}
\end{equation}

where $\boldsymbol{\hat{d}}$ is the dipole moment operator associated with the TLS, $\boldsymbol{\hat{E}}$ is the electric field operator associated with the QHO \cite{General2024-JCM_relevance}. Several papers \cite{General2010_USC_failure, Context2024-CircuitQED} address these issues by using the non-linear JCM, an extension of the original model. 
We shall now explore the failures of the JCM in certain coupling regimes, and alternative models that make up for these pitfalls.

\subsubsection{Coupling Regimes and the Breakdown of The Jaynes-Cummings Model}

%%%%%^% INSERT FIGURE OF DIFFERENT COUPLING REGIMES 

In the WC regime, the coupling strength satisfies $g \ll \kappa, \gamma$, where $\gamma$ represents the decay rate of the TLS and $\kappa$ is the decay rate of the QHO \cite{Context2017-USC_failure}. In this regime, dissipative processes dominate, and energy exchanged between the TLS and the QHO is rapidly lost to the environment, preventing coherent oscillations from developing. As the coupling strength increases beyond the loss rates, the system enters the SC regime, characterized by $g > \kappa, \gamma$. Here, coherent interactions prevail, allowing the TLS and the QHO to exchange energy multiple times before decoherence occurs.

The JCM provides an accurate description of this regime, successfully predicting Rabi oscillations, which are periodic energy exchanges between the TLS and the QHO \cite{Context1993-JC_Verification}. This process causes the TLS to transition repeatedly between its ground and excited states, oscillating at the Rabi frequency $\Omega_R$ \cite{Context_-Rabi_oscillations}. These oscillations are a hallmark of strong coupling and serve as experimental signatures of coherent light–matter interaction.

In a 2024 review of the JCM, Daniele De Bernardis et al. examine the continued relevance of the JCM in modern cavity QED and discuss the various approximations that underpin its validity \cite{General2024-JCM_relevance}. Bernardis states that in the SC regime, $\Omega_R > \kappa, \gamma$, and define the cooperativity parameter as $C = 4\Omega^{2}_R/(\gamma\kappa)$, and $C > 1$ marks the SC regime. Furthermore, $\Omega_R > \omega_c, \omega_a$, where $\omega_c, \omega_a$ are the bare excitation frequencies of the QHO and TLS respectively (see equation \eqref{JC_H}). However, in the ultrastrong-coupling (USC) regime, the coupling strength is no longer a small perturbation, but becomes comparable to the bare excitation frequencies. Bernardis introduces an analogy to the cooperativity parameter, defining  the normalised coupling parameter as $\zeta = 4\Omega^{2}_R/(\omega_c\omega_a)$, with $\zeta \sim \mathcal{O}(1) $ indicating the USC regime. Importantly, Bernardis emphasises that the cooperativity parameter is not sufficient to describe the USC regime. In certain experimental systems such as Rydberg atoms in cavities, the cooperativity parameter is much greater than $1$ ($C \sim 10-100$), and the normalised coupling parameter remains small ($\zeta \sim 10^{-5} $), yet the JCM still remains applicable . However, in other experiments such as superconducting qubits in cavities, $\zeta$ ranges from 0.01-100, a regime in which the JCM is not valid. Thus, $C$ does not indicate when the coupling strength itself is large enough to invalidate the JCM’s structure. Instead, $\zeta$ serves as the appropriate measure, distinguishing systems where the JCM remains valid.\\
\\
The failure of the JCM is not solely due to large coupling strength relative to the system’s fundamental frequencies (quantified by $\zeta$), but also due to one of the key approximations of the JCM: the RWA \cite{General2024-JCM_relevance}. In the same 2024 review, Bernardis also examines the breakdown of the RWA in the USC regime. The RWA neglects counter-rotating terms (see equation \eqref{RWA}) which in turn describe processes where a photon may simultaneously be created/annihilated with a respective excitation/de-excitation of the TLS. In WC and SC regimes, these counter-rotating terms are stated to be negligible and to commute with the excitation number operator $|n\rangle$ of the QHO. This commutation gives the JCM a $U(1)$ symmetry; the JCM can thus be expressed in a block-diagonal form, which in turn provides a simple analytical solution. However, in the USC regime, the coupling strength is comparable to the bare excitation frequencies, and the counter-rotating terms can no longer be neglected. The counter-rotating terms no longer commute with  $|n\rangle$, and the $U(1)$ symmetry is broken. The JCM no longer has a simple analytical solution, and new interactions emerge, whose effects are not captured by the JCM. 

One of the clearest experimental observations of the RWA breakdown is the Bloch-Siegert shift. If the driving of a QHO is strong enough that the Rabi frequency approaches the Larmor Frequency (defined to be $\omega_a/2\pi$), the counter-rotating terms are non-negligible. This leads to a shift in the energy-level transition of the TLS, which is known as the Bloch-Siegert shift \cite{Context2010-Bloch_Siegert}. In 2010, P. Forn-D\'iaz et al. experimentally observed the Bloch-Siegert shift when studying a resonant circuit (modelled as a QHO) coupled to a superconducting qubit (modelled as a TLS). The system's interaction strength reaches $g/\omega_c \approx 0.1$, a USC regime. Forn-D\'iaz observes a 50MHz energy shift in the qubit's energy-level transition, verifying the Bloch-Siegert shift and importantly demonstrating the RWA's breakdown in USC regimes. Moreover, Forn-D\'iaz compares the experimental results to the JCM and the Quantum Rabi Model, and importantly concludes that the Rabi Model accurately describes the experimental results, whereas the JCM's predictions fail. This experimental validation of the Bloch-Siegert shift reinforces the need for more general models beyond the JCM, such as the Quantum Rabi Model and the Dicke Model, which fully account for non-perturbative light–matter interactions.


\subsubsection{Alternative Models}

One of the primary alternatives to the JCM in the context of a single TLS coupled to a single quantised mode of a QHO is the Quantum Rabi Model (QRM) \cite{Context1936-Rabi}. As outlined in section \ref{subsec_history}, the QRM was formulated in 1936, nearly thirty years prior to the JCM. The drawback to the model, however, lies in the fact that it is not exactly solvable \cite{Hamiltonian2017-Rabi}. The JCM was therefore devised as a model which sought to simplify the QRM by applying the RWA. According to \cite{General2024-JCM_relevance}, the QRM may be described by the Hamiltonian

\begin{equation}
    \hat{H_R} = \hat{H}_{TLS} + \hat{H}_{QHO} + \hat{H}_{int}, 
\end{equation} \label{JC_H}
where 
\begin{align*}
    \begin{aligned}
        \hat{H}_{TLS} &\equiv \frac{\hbar\omega_a}{2}\hat{\sigma}_z \\
        \hat{H}_{QHO} &\equiv \hbar\omega_ca^\dagger a \\
        \hat{H}_{int} &\equiv \hbar g(a + a^\dagger)\hat{\sigma}_{x}
    \end{aligned}
\end{align*},

and $\hat{\sigma}_{x}$ is the Pauli matrix for the TLS. The difference between the Rabi and JC Hamiltonian is the interaction part of the Hamiltonian $H_{int}$. For the QRM, the interaction Hamiltonian may be written as a sum of two terms:
$\hbar g(a + a^\dagger)\hat{\sigma}_{x} = g(\hat{\sigma}_{ge}a^\dagger+\hat{\sigma}_{ge}a) + g(\hat{\sigma}_{ge}a^+\hat{\sigma}_{ge}a^\dagger)$ \cite{Hamiltonian2017-Rabi}. This decomposition directly displays the rotating and counter-rotating terms as seen outside of the RWA approximation. Thus the QRM has a clear advantage over the JCM: if we consider systems in which the RWA is not valid, the QRM can fully capture the system in its description. On the one hand, the QRM has no simple analytical solution. This is due to the QRM's counter-rotating term not commuting with the excitation number operator, and the $U(1)$ symmetry is not present. On the other hand, the QRM can still be numerically diagonalisable, with libraries such as the QuTip Python library providing the necessary methods \cite{General2024-JCM_relevance}. 
The QRM, when the coupling is small, is indistinguishable from the JCM. In higher-strength coupling regimes, such as USC, we find that the difference between the two models become greater due to the counter-rotating terms being more prominent \cite{General2024-JCM_relevance}. A consequence of these counter-rotating terms is that the empty cavity vacuum (i.e. the ground state) is no longer an eigenstate of the system, and we find virtual photons present in the coupled ground state of the system itself; in fact, one of the central ideas in the development of cQED in the USC regime was to detect these virtual photons. It is clear, then, that the main advantage of the QRM is in fully capturing system dynamics in the USC and beyond, where counter-rotating terms become increasingly prominent. In using the QRM, however, we lose the intuition and simple analytical solvability.\\
\\
Another alternative to the JCM is the Dicke model \cite{Context1954-Dicke}. In 1953, Robert Dicke introduced the Dicke Model to describe superradiance by considering the light emission from a large ensemble of atoms (modelled as an ensemble of TLS's) coupled to a single quantised mode of a cavity (modelled as a QHO) \cite{Hamiltonian2019-Dicke}. The corresponding Dicke Hamiltonian is written as 

\begin{equation}
    \hat{H}_D = \omega_ca^\dagger a  +\omega_a\sum^N_{j=1}\hat{\sigma}_j^z + \frac{2\lambda}{\sqrt{N}}(a + a^\dagger)\sum_j\hat{\sigma}_j^x,
\end{equation}

where $\hat{\sigma}_j^z$ and $\sigma_j^x$ are the Pauli spin operators, N is the number of atoms in the ensemble, and $\lambda$ is the TLS-QHO coupling strength \cite{Hamiltonian2019-Dicke}. Unlike both the JCM and QRM, the Dicke model accounts an ensemble of TLS's in a QHO environment, which collectively enhance the Rabi frequency by a factor $\sqrt{N}$. This ensemble of TLS's allows a system which utilises the Dicke model to achieve USC regimes and beyond far more easily than that of the single TLS setups of the QRM and JCM. One of the most striking consequences of this model is the emergence of superradiance, a phase transition where the TLS ensemble spontaneously emits photons; a behaviour absent in the JCM and QRM. Furthermore, the Dicke model is exactly solvable in the thermodynamic limit ($ N \rightarrow \infty$), since the system becomes better describes by a linear optical approach where the cavity and material may both be described by QHOs \cite{General2024-JCM_relevance}. On the other hand, it is not clear what this effect this linearity has on modifying ground-state proerties. Furthermore, it has been shown that many other single-particle effects are not enhanced by the ensemlble of TLSs, and in fact the Dicke model makes it harder to modify the properties of matter in the system. Thus, the Dicke model extends the JCM and QRM to an ensemble of TLSs, making it an ideal framework for studying quantum many-body effects in cQED. However, the ensemble does not necessarily enhance many desirable effects, and the only notable effect is in enhancing the Rabi frequency. Given the more complex nature of the Dicke model, it is generally even more difficult to solve than the QRM, making the model undesirable to employ in a single TLS-QHO system, where the QRM and JCM are favoured. \\
\\
It is clear, then, that even to this day the JCM prevails as one of the simplest models of a TLS-QHO, especially in the context of describing quantum light-matter systems. The model has certain drawbacks, however. It fails to capture dynamics at stronger coupling regimes, and its simplicity is often its downfall, with physicists frequently using extensions of the model to suit their system of interest. Nevertheless, whilst other models such as the QRM and Dicke Model hold certain advantages (such as being valid in stronger coupling regimes, or describing collective effects of an ensemble of TLSs), the JCM still remains a clear, exactly solvable, and intuitive model which physicists will undoubtedly continue to use to understand system dynamics. Beyond system dynamics, however, modern quantum technologies and systems increasingly rely on quantum resources such as entanglement and coherence, to access, control and manipulate quantum states. Understanding how these resources emerge and evolve is essential for advancing both theoretical and experimental works. We now turn to explore these fundamental quantum properties, and look at their current use within the scope of the JCM.

\section{Quantum Resources: Entanglement and Coherence} \label{sec_QRes}

Quantum resources form the foundation of quantum information science, enabling quantum technologies such as computation, communication and key distribution. Among the various resource theories, entanglement and coherence are two of the most fundamental and widely studies resources \cite{CohEnt2019-QRT_def}. Entanglement identifies the separability of a quantum state, whereas coherence captures the amount of superposition in a quantum state. Whilst entanglement has long been regarded as the primary quantum resource, coherence, a relatively new resource, is gaining significant traction \cite{CohEnt2019-QRT_def}. This section explores the formal definitions and various key measures of both entanglement and coherence. 

\subsection{Entanglement} \label{subsec_ent}

The most distinguished quantum resource is entanglement, a uniquely quantum phenomenon that describes non-classical correlations between subsystems of a composite quantum systems. A total state $|Psi\rangle$ is said to be entangled if it cannot be written as a product state i.e.

\begin{equation}
    |\Psi\rangle \neq |\psi_A\rangle \otimes |\psi_B\rangle,
\end{equation}

where $|\psi_A\rangle, |\psi_B\rangle$ are pure states of subsystems A and B. If a state \textit{can} be expressed in this form, it is deemed separable and exhibits only classical correlations. The quantification of pure state entanglement has been rigorously examined, and measures such as the Von Neumann Entropy (VNE) suffice. However, mixed state entanglement quantification is significantly more challenging. \\
\\
One of the most celebrated measures of Entanglement is the VNE. D\'enes Petz neatly summarises Johann von Neumann's seminal measure of Quantum Entanglement in a 2001 paper \cite{Entanglement2001-VNE_Definition}. von Neumann's entropy measure generalises the classical Shannon entropy to quantum systems by quantifying the the extent to which a state is mixed (and by extension, entangled). Petz highlights that von Neumann derived his formulation of entropy in a 'gedanken' (thought) experiment in his search for a formalism of quantum thermodynamics. von Neumann showed that quantum entropy behaves analogously to its classical counterpart whilst incorporating unique quantum features. Mathematically, the VNE \cite{Entanglement2001-VNE_Definition} measures the degree of entanglement for a pure bipartite system $|\Psi\rangle$(such as the TLS-QHO system), and depends on either of the subsystem density matrices' eigenvalues

\begin{equation}
    S_{vn}(\rho) = -\text{Tr}(\rho\log({\rho}))
\end{equation},

where $\rho$ is the density operator of the total bipartite system. Petz further highlights that the entropy of a subsystem $\rho_{sub}$ of $\rho$ also fully captures the entanglement of the total state, if the density operator of the total state is pure. If the subsystems are entangled, then $S(\rho_{sub}) > 0$, whereas if they are separable, then $S(\rho_{sub}) = 0$. Petz also notes the mixing property of entropy, showing that the VNE increases under quantum measurements, reflecting the irreversibility of quantum states. The VNE finds itself at the forefront of Entanglement quantification, and is a canonical measurement of entanglement itself. In 2019, Craig Lent examines the entropy of pure state operators under unitary evolution, and finds that under unitary evolution, the state is completely reversible with no loss of quantum information \cite{Entanglement2019_VNE_example}. Moreover, he verifies that the entropy increases in a way that is analogous and consistent to classical statistical entropy and the second law of thermodynamics. We find another use of the VNE as recently as Febuary 2025, wherein Ram Narayan Deb provides a generalised relationship between the VNE of the subsystems of a composite state, and different types of squeezing in the context of Ramsey spectroscopy \cite{Entanglement2025_VNE_example}. In section \ref{sec_QRes_app}, we shall see the further applications of the VNE in the context of a TLS-QHO system. \\
\\
he Relative Entropy of Entanglement (REE), as formulated by Vlatko Vedral and Leah Henderson in 2000, provides a more general framework for quantifying entanglement, particularly for mixed states \cite{Entanglement2000-REE_definition}. The REE is defined as: 

\begin{equation}
    E_{REE}(\rho) = \min_{\sigma \in D}  S(\rho||\sigma)
\end{equation}

where $ S(\rho||\sigma) = \text{Tr}(\rho\log(\rho) - \rho\log(\sigma))$ is the quantum relative entropy, and the minimisation is taken over the set $D$ of all separable states $\sigma$. This formulation quantifies the 'distance' between an entangled state and the closest separable state. 

Vedral and Henderson show that REE serves as an upper bound on distillable entanglement, which is the amount of pure entanglement extractable from a mixed state use local operations and classical communication (LOCC). They further mention that other entanglement measures, such as the Entanglement of Formation (EoF) and the VNE, may be seen as special cases of REE, thus establishing the measure as a unification of other entanglement measures. A key result of the authors' work is the irreversibility of entanglement transformation in mixed states. Unlike pure states, where entanglement can be converted between different forms, mixed-state entanglement exhibits asymmetry: the entanglement required to create a mixed state (EoF) is always greater than the distillable entanglement. This discrepancy arises due to the loss of classical information about the state, and is a feature which the REE captures explicitly. Compared to the VNE, the REE is more general as it applies to both pure and mixed states, and applies entanglement beyond well-defined bipartite systems. The REE for mixed states, however, is notoriously difficult to calculate analytically, and requires numerical methods to compute \cite{Entanglement2009-REE_VNapplied}, unlike the VNE which has an incredibly simple analytical solution. \\
\\
Whilst the VNE and REE are key measures for pure and mixed states respectively, there are some other notable measures of entanglement which we shall now briefly explore. 

William K. Wootters introduced concurrence as a measure of entanglement specifically for a pair of qubits, providing a direct method to compute the EoF for mixed states \cite{Entanglement2001-WC_qubits}. The concurrence, $C(\rho)$ of a pure two-qubit density matrix is given by $C(|\Psi\rangle) = |\langle\psi|\Tilde{\psi}\rangle|$, where $|\Tilde{\psi}\rangle = (\sigma_y\otimes\sigma_y)|\psi*\rangle$ is the spin flipped state of $|\psi\rangle$. Wootters establishes the connection between concurrence and EoF by showing that, for a two-qubit system, the EoF is given by

\begin{equation}
    E_f(\rho) = h\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{1-C^2}}{2}\right)
\end{equation}, 

where $h(x) = - x\log_2x - (1 - x)\log_2(1 -x)$ is the binary entropy function. The concurrence's significance is in providing an exact formulation of the EoF, which was until then difficult to compute for mixed states. Compared to the REE, concurrence offers a simple approach to entanglement quantification for mixed-state entanglement, but is limited in its scope to two-qubit systems. Efforts have been made to expand concurrence to arbitrary dimensions \cite{Entanglement2001-WC_arbdim}, with some success in qudit (d-dimensional qudit) systems as recently as 2025 \cite{Entanglement2025_WC_arbidm_example}. However, the measure is not yet applicable to single TLSs coupled to one quantised mode of a QHO.

Another well-known measure of entanglement is the Entanglement R\'enyi $\alpha$-entropy (ER$\alpha$E). In 2016, Yu-Xin Wang et al. discuss ER$\alpha$E, noting that the measure introduces a continous parameter $\alpha$ to the VNE, thus providing a broader spectrum of entanglement measures \cite{Entanglement2016-ERaE_Definition}. The ER$\alpha$E, for a pure state $|\Psi\rangle$ with subsystems A and B, is defined as:

\begin{equation}
    R_{\alpha}(|\Psi\rangle) \equiv \frac{1}{1-\alpha}\log_2{\text{Tr}(\rho_B^\alpha)}
\end{equation},

where $\rho_B^\alpha$ is the subsystem of the reduced density operator of the total state $|\Psi\rangle$. Wang importantly states that for pure bipartite states the ER$\alpha$E reduces to the VNE in the limit $\alpha \rightarrow 1$, yet again showing the importance of the VNE as a specialised measure of entanglement for pure states. The generalisation to mixed states follows a convex-roof construction method, which in turn requires a minimisation over all possible pure state decompositions, making the calculation computationally difficult. Compared to the previous entanglement measures, the ER$\alpha$E uniquely presents a continuos measure of entanglement over the spectrum of $\alpha$, enabling finer-grain tuning of the entanglement measure. This makes the ER$\alpha$E particularly useful in contexts where we want to capture more nuanced details in the entanglement structure of the system. 

\subsection{Coherence}

Whilst entanglement remains the most studied and used quantum resource, a newer phenomenon that has gained traction is coherence. Alexander Streltsov et al. extensively review coherence in a 2017 colloquium, defining the resource as the ability of a quantum state to exhibit superpositions in given basis of choice \cite{Coherence2017-Colloquium}. Streltsov states that, whilst coherence has been experimentally studied in optical physics, its role as a quantum resource has only recently been formalised within the axiomatic theoretical framework of Quantum Resource Theory as described in \cite{CohEnt2019-QRT_def}. Despite its major role in quantum computation and quantum thermodynamics, coherence to this day is a rapidly evolving field of quantum physics. \\
\\
One key measure of coherence is the Relative Entropy of Coherence (REC) \cite{Coherence2014-seed}. In 2014, Tillmann Baumgratz et al. introduced general distance-based coherence measure:

\begin{equation}
    C_D(\rho) = \inf_{\sigma \in I} D(\rho,\sigma)
\end{equation}

where D is a distance and we take the infimum over the set of incoherent states, and $\sigma$ is a reference state. If, similarly to entanglement, we take the distance measure to be the quantum relative entropy, we obtain the REC, $C_r$:

\begin{equation}
    C_r(\rho) = C_d(\rho) = S(\rho_{diag}) - S(\rho),
\end{equation}

where $S$ is the VNE, and $\rho_{diag}$ is the state obtained by removing all off-diagonal elements. From this formalism Baumgratz notes one of the defining features of coherence: basis-dependency. For any composite system, the preferred basis for studying coherence is the the tensor product of the corresponding local reference basis states for each subsystem. Furthermore, the REC aligns closely with the quantum relative entropy measure used in entanglement theory. In fact, its formulation mirrors the REE, where coherence instead plays the role of quantifying quantum correlations. This connection reinforces the role of coherence as a fundamental quantum resource, analogous to entanglement. A 2024 paper by Ruvi Lecamwasam et al. examines the REC as a quantifier of performance in Bayesian metrology \cite{Coherence2024-REC_development}. In particular, Lecamwasam shows that REC can be applied to an ensemble of states, and notes that this REC of the ensemble allows visualisation of how much information is inaccessible within a given measurement scheme applied to a system. \\
\\
Another important measure of coherence is the Norm of Coherence. In the same 2014 paper which defined the REC, Baumgratz defines the norm, $C_l$, as a direct measure of a state's off-diagonal elements \cite{Coherence2014-seed}:

\begin{equation}
    C_l(\rho) = \sum_{i,j}|\rho_{i,j}|.
\end{equation}

Similarly to the REC, the norm is a computationally accessible measure of coherence. Baumgratz however states that unlike the REC, the norm lacks a clear interpretation in terms of coherence distillation. Another distinction from the REC is that the norm is highly sensitive to small coherence contributions, making it a valuable tool for detecting weak coherence in quantum systems. On the other hand, the sensitivity of this measure can lead to challenges in experimental implementation, where small fluctuations can significantly change the measured coherence. Much like the REC, the norm of coherence is still being developed to this day. In a 2024 paper by Kang-Kang Yang et. al, the norm of coherence's formalism is refined with tighter superadditivity inequalities and extended to arbitrary multi-qubit states \cite{Coherence2024-Norm_refinement}.

Now that we have defined quantum resources and explored the key measures of entanglement and coherence, it is important to examine their role in the JCM.


\section{Application of Quantum Resources to The Jaynes-Cummings Model} \label{sec_QRes_app}

As seen from section \ref{sec_TLS-QHO}, the JCM can capture many physical systems in its description. Quantum resources, however, have recently become of great interest to physicists studying quantum systems because they provide insight system dynamics, and allow fine-grain control of over quantum states. Thus, investigating these resources within the JCM is essential for unlocking the model's full potential and for aligning with current advancements in quantum information science. In this section, we explore how entanglement and coherence measures can be applied within the JCM to characterise the systems and develop experimental control mechanisms. \\
\\
As previously mentioned in \ref{subsubsec_cQED} in the context of cQED, in \cite{QResJCm2004-cQED_coherence}the authors state that controlling the coherence of the atom (TLS) directly influences how quickly the cavity (QHO) is depleted. The study hints at manipulating coherence in the TLS in order to control the lifespan of the cavity. This is exactly what Anette Messinger expands on later in a 2020 paper, in which she explores coherence in the JCM by examining how TLS-modelled atoms (individually fed into the cavity) interact with a QHO-modelled cavity \cite{CohEnt2020-Cavity_controlled_coherence}. The study builds upon the exact JC Hamiltonian in equation \eqref{JC_H}. Messinger focuses on coherence transfer from the cavity to the atoms, and analyses the degradation of coherence in the cavity as it is distributed among atoms, quantifying coherence using the REC. Her key finding is that the initial coherence in the cavity is not immediately depleted, but rather there is an enhancement in the coherence up to an optimal number of atom-cavity interactions. Specifically, the cavity can be used for approximately $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ atomic interactions before the degradation becomes significant. This phenomenon is tied to the JCM's ability to preserve the total excitation number. Furthermore, she ties her study to coherence catalysis, which is the ability to repeatedly extract coherence without degredation. By using the JCM as a tool to achieve simple, intuitive analytical results, the paper highlights the practical implications of coherence control in cQED.

A recent 2024 study by Luis Castaños-Cervantes et al. continues the exploration of coherence in the JCM by examining single atoms streamed into one of two separate single-mode cavities. As with \cite{CohEnt2020-Cavity_controlled_coherence}, the study uses the Hamiltonian in equation \eqref{JC_H} to describe the system. Coherent control of the two cavities in this system is said to enable novel possibilities of atomic manipulation, which were not previously possible. Castaños-Cervantes first defines a control qubit which determines the cavity that the atom interacts with. If the qubit is in the basis state $|0\rangle$, the atom interacts with the $C_0$ cavity. If the qubit is in the basis state $|1\rangle$, the atom instead interacts with the $C_1$ cavity. By preparing the qubit in a superposition state, the atom interacts with both cavities simultaneously, introducing coherence between the the two modes:

\begin{equation}
    |\theta,\phi\rangle_c = \cos{\theta}|0\rangle_c + e^{i\phi}\sin{\theta}|1\rangle_c,
\end{equation}

where $\theta$ controls the weight of the superposition between the basis states of the qubit and $\phi$ represents the phase factor between the two basis states. The study then explores how this coherence affects the atomic population inversion, and finds that controlling the coherence of the atom-cavity interaction yields a tunable Rabi frequency and enables control of quantum state preparation. Moreover, Castaños-Cervantes demonstrates that coherence in the JCM can be used to generate entangled states of the cavity by measuring the qubit and atom after the interaction. This paper extends the JCM into modern quantum information science by using coherence to control the system in novel ways. Furthermore, it touches on entanglement within the model, which we shall now look into.\\
\\
In a 2009 paper, E. Hern\'andez Concepci\'on et al. examine entanglement in a continously measured TLS coupled to a QHO, again using the JC Hamiltonian in equation \eqref{JC_H} to model their system and extending it to include the measurement effects \cite{Entanglement2009-REE_VNapplied}. Entanglement is quantified using two key measures: the VNE and the REE, using the same formulations as in section \ref{subsec_ent}. The study finds that, due to the 'flip-flop' effect of the TLS-QHO interaction, the VNE oscillates between 0 and $\ln{2}$. The study then numerically computes the REE, and finds that a double-peak structure emerges in the REE distribution, indicating that entanglement is maximised at a coupling strength $g\approx0.5$ and a QHO decay rate of $k\approx1$ both expressed in units of the TLS decay rate $\gamma$. Overall, the paper finds that entanglement persists despite the the degradation of the system to the environment.

Jonas Larson et al. provide a comprehensive summary of the JCM in a 2024 book \cite{General2024-JC_overview}. Larson discusses entanglement as a key quantum resource that emerges within the TLS-QHO system. It reviews historical contributions, and looks at the first introduction of entanglement in the JCM in the 1990s, using the VNE measure. Since the JCM preserves the total excitation number, measuring the three components of the bloch vector of the JCM allows direct access to the entanglement. The paper also employs concurrence as a measure of the bipartite entanglement of the JCM, computing the concurrence using the eigenvalues of the spin-flipped density matrix of the system. Larson finds that the concurrence exhibits oscillatory behaviour within two-TLS JCM systems. This mirrors the VNE calculations of \cite{Entanglement2009-REE_VNapplied}, albeit with a maximum concurrence of $C_{max}\approx0.98$, indicating near maximal entanglement between the TLS and QHO (since concurrence ranges from 0 to 1). Larson also highlights the dependence of entanglement on the initial state. As with \cite{Entanglement2009-REE_VNapplied}, if the atom starts in an excited state, entanglement grows significantly over time. Overall, the JCM is shown to be a good example of entanglement in quantum light-matter interactions, and allows for control of the state through initial conditions.

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec_Conclusion}

The JCM is a canonical model for quantum light-matter interaction. In this review, we have highlighted a range of systems which the JCM fully and accurately captures in its descriptions, from well-established fields like cQED, to emerging, nascent fields such as NV centres and circuit QED. However, the JCM has significant limitations: it breaks down in USC regime due to the failure of the RWA, and does not account for multi-TLS multi-QHO coupling. In such cases, the Rabi Model and Dicke model provide more appropriate descriptions. The trade-off, however, is that these models usually require complex (and often numerical) analyses, whereas the JCM provides intuitive, simple analytical solutions. Due to this, the JCM is ideal for focussing on systems where there is only one TLS interacting with one quantised mode of a QHO up to the SC regime. 

Beyond its role in describing physical interactions, the JCM provides a simple and intuitive framework for extracting quantum resources such as entanglement and coherence. The primary entanglement measures considered in recent studies are the VNE and the more computationally intensive REE. Wootters' concurrence is occasionally used but is primarily suited to two-qubit systems. The R\'enyi entanglement entropy measure, though not widely applied to the JCM, may offer a promising direction due to its tunable $\alpha$ parameter, allowing finer control over entanglement quantification, similar to the REE.

For coherence, the REC has been the primary measure, with studies demonstrating that controlling the TLS's coherence slows the coherence degradation of the QHO, enabling better control of the system. In contrast, less attention has been given to the coherence norm measure, which could be particularly useful for detecting weak coherence due to its sensitivity to small coherence changes. Future research may benefit from further exploration of these alternative measures to refine our understanding of quantum resources within the JCM.
