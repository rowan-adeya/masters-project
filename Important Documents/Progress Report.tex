\section{Introduction}
A Two-Level System (TLS) coupled to a Quantum Harmonic Oscillator (QHO) is a widely used model applicable to various systems in different fields of science. It can describe atoms in an optical cavity \cite{JCHamiltonianDef} and superconducting qubit strongly coupled to an electromagnetic environment\cite{Superconducting...}. In the fields of biological and chemical physics in regard to electron transfer, spin relaxation, molecular vibrational relaxation \cite{...} and so on.

Thus, the aim of this project is to understand the the TLS-QHO system and study it from both closed and open quantum dynamical approaches. Specifically, we will be considering different interactions of the system, and focus on entanglement and coherence properties. This approach will give me a broad understanding of the model and its plethora of uses in different fields of sciences.\\
\\
This progress report summarises the work done so far on both the Research Essay and the Final Project, and outlines future aims and goals. We begin by looking at the work done so far on the research project. We then look at the progress made on the literature review. Finally, we discuss the future aims and goals.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\section{Preliminary Investigations}}
The majority of the work done so far, as detailed in the Project Outline, is preliminary investigations and basic closed quantum dynamics of the model. 
\\
\subsection{\normalsize{Diagonalizing the Hamiltonian of the TLS-QHO System}}

We first define the Jaynes-Cummings\cite{JCHamiltonianDef} Hamiltonian\cite{Hagelstein2LSHO_Desc} $\hat{H}$, which describes a TLS interacting with a QHO; it will later be of use when analysing the time evolution of the system. 

\begin{equation}
    \hat{H} = \frac{\hbar\omega_1}{2}\hat{\sigma}_z + \hbar\omega_2(a^\dagger a + \frac{1}{2}) + \hbar G(a\hat{\sigma}_{eg} + a^\dagger\hat{\sigma}_{ge}),
\end{equation}
\\
where $\omega_1$ is the energy difference between the two levels of the TLS, $\omega_2$ is the frequency of the harmonic oscillator, $\sigma_z$ is the Pauli spin operator, $\sigma_{eg}$ and $\sigma_{ge}$ are the respective excitation and de-excitation operators that act on the TLS, $a^\dagger$ and $a$ are the respective creation and annihilation operators that act on the QHO, and $G$ is the coupling strength constant. The Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ can be split into three different parts representing the contributions from: \eqref{H_TLS} the TLS; \eqref{H_QHO} the QHO; \eqref{H_INT} the interaction between the TLS and QHO. 

\begin{equation*}
    \hat{H} = \hat{H}_{TLS} + \hat{H}_{QHO} + \hat{H}_{int}
\end{equation*}
where 
\begin{align}
    \hat{H}_{TLS}\equiv \frac{\hbar\omega_1}{2}\hat{\sigma}_z \label{H_TLS}\\
    \hat{H}_{QHO}\equiv \frac{\hbar\omega_1}{2}\hat{\sigma}_z \label{H_QHO}\\
    \hat{H}_{int}\equiv \frac{\hbar\omega_1}{2}\hat{\sigma}_z \label{H_INT}
\end{align}
\\
It is important to note that later on in the project, we will be studying different forms of the interaction Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_{int}$.
We may now look at the joint state of the TLS-QHO system, which is given by:

\begin{equation}
    |\Psi\rangle = \alpha|g,n+1\rangle + \beta|e,n\rangle \label{joint_state},
\end{equation}
\\
where $g$ and $e$ represent the ground and excited states respectively, and n denotes the number of excitations of the Harmonic Oscillator, $n=0,1,2,3,...$ . To diagonalise $\hat{H}$, we must firstly represent the Hamiltonian as a matrix in the joint basis. The diagonalised Hamiltonian Matrix $D$ is then given by:

\begin{equation}
D = \begin{bmatrix}
\hbar\omega_2(n+1) + k & 0 \\
0 & \hbar\omega_2(n+1) - k
\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
\vspace{2cm}
where 
\begin{equation*}
    k = \hbar\sqrt{\frac{\omega_1^2 + \omega_2^2}{4}-\frac{\omega_1\omega_2}{2}+G^2(n+1)}.  
\end{equation*}
\\
\subsection{\normalsize{Time Evolved State Vector}}

Now that we have the diagonalised Hamiltonian, we can proceed to calculate the time-evolved state $|\Psi(t)\rangle$ for a given initial state of $|\Psi(t=0)\rangle = |e,0\rangle$. For this initial state, the number of excitations of the QHO $n=0$ (assuming that there is only one excitation in the joint system at any time), and so our constant $k$ now becomes $k'$:

\begin{equation*}
    k' = \hbar\sqrt{\frac{\omega_1^2 + \omega_2^2}{4}-\frac{\omega_1\omega_2}{2}+G^2}
\end{equation*}
\\
Since our diagonalised Hamiltonian is in the eigenbasis, we must convert the initial state into the eigenbasis. Then we use the evolution operator

\begin{equation}
    \hat{U(t)} = e^{-\frac{iDt}{\hbar}}
\end{equation}

to calculate $|\Psi(t)\rangle$ - this process is made far simpler due to the Hamiltonian being diagonalized, since raising a matrix to a power is trivialised if the matrix is diagonal. Using $|\Psi(t)\rangle = \hat{U(t)}|\Psi(t=0)\rangle$, we obtain the final time-evolved state:

\begin{equation}
    |\Psi(t)\rangle = \begin{bmatrix}
        e^{-i(\omega_2 + \frac{k'}{\hbar})t}(1+(\frac{a+k'}{c})^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}}(\frac{a+k'}{c}) \\
        e^{-i(\omega_2 - \frac{k'}{\hbar})t}(1+(\frac{a-k'}{c})^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}}(\frac{a-k'}{c})
    \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
\\
where $a = \hbar(\frac{\omega_1 - \omega_2}{2})$, $c = \hbar G\sqrt{n+1} = \hbar G$ since $n=0$ from our initial state, and the time-evolved state is written in terms of its eigenstates.
\\
\subsection{\normalsize{Time-Evolved Density Matrix}}

In order to calculate entanglement, the easiest way often is to first determine the density matrix for a pure state. In order to find the time-evolved density matrix, I had to firstly convert $|\Psi(t)\rangle$ back into the original basis (see equation (2)). For the general density matrix, $\rho$, we have:

\begin{equation}
    \rho = \begin{bmatrix}
        \alpha\alpha^* & \alpha\beta^* \\
        \alpha^*\beta & \beta\beta^*
    \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}

where the first row and first column represents $|g,n+1\rangle$ and $\langle g,n+1|$ respectively, and  and the second row and column represent $|e,n\rangle$ and $\langle e,n|$ respectively. We must then determine the coefficients $\alpha(t)$ and $\beta(t)$ for the time-evolved density matrix. Finally, we perform a partial trace over each respective subsystem (TLS or QHO) to obtain the subsystem density matrices.

\begin{align}
    \rho(t)_{QHO} = \alpha(t)\alpha^*(t)|1\rangle\langle1| + \beta(t)\beta^*(t)|0\rangle\langle0|
    \\
    \rho(t)_{TLS} = \alpha(t)\alpha^*(t)|g\rangle\langle g| + \beta(t)\beta^*(t)|e\rangle\langle e|,
\end{align}

where 

\begin{align*}
    \alpha(t)\alpha^*(t) &=\eta_+^2 + \eta_-^2 + 2\eta_+\eta_-\cos{\frac{k'}{\hbar}t} \\
    \beta(t)\beta^*(t) &= \eta_+^2(\frac{a+k'}{c})^2 + \eta_-^2(\frac{a-k'}{c})^2 + 2\eta_+\eta_-(\frac{a+k'}{c})(\frac{a-k'}{c})\cos{\frac{k'}{\hbar}t} \\
\end{align*}

and 

\begin{equation*}
    \eta_{\pm}= (1+(\frac{a\pm k'}{c})^2)^{-1}(\frac{a\pm k'}{c}).
\end{equation*}
\\
\subsection{\normalsize{Entanglement Quantification}}

From here, we may begin to look at entanglement quantification. Let us consider four different measurements of entanglement: the Von Neumann Entropy of Entanglement\cite{DerivationVNEntropy}; the Relative Entropy of Entanglement (REE)\cite{OverviewREE},\cite{GeneratingREE}; the Entanglement Renyi $\alpha$ Entropy (ER$\alpha$E)\cite{DefinitionERaE}; Wooters' Concurrence and Entanglement of Formation \cite{}. 

The Von Neumann entropy of Entanglement\cite{DerivationVNEntropy} measures the degree of entanglement for a pure bipartite system such as the TLS-QHO system, and depends on either of the subsystem density matrices' eigenvalues. 

\begin{equation}
    S = -\text{Tr}(\rho_{TLS}\ln({\rho_{TLS}})) = -\text{Tr}(\rho_{QHO}\ln({\rho_{QHO}}))
\end{equation}

Furthermore, if the matrix is diagonalised, the Von Neumann entropy reduces to:

\begin{equation}
    S = \sum_i -\lambda_i\ln({\lambda_i})
\end{equation}

Since there is no mixing for either of the two subsystems, their density matrices are diagonal, and the non-zero values are thus the eigenvalues. Here, we make the following approximation\cite{Bhattacharya2LSHO_Damping}: we assume that the TLS and QHO are in resonance, i.e. $\omega_1=\omega_2=\omega$. Using the QHO subsystem, we find that the Von Neumann entropy of entanglement oscillates between $0$ and $\ln{2}$.

The REE measures the minimum "distance" between a given quantum state $\rho$ and all its other disentangled density matrices $\sigma$\cite{GeneratingREE}. In order to calculate REE, it is best done via numerical methods. However, there is a trivial answer for our system\cite{OverviewREE}: for pure states, REE reduces to the Von Neumann entropy of entanglement.

\begin{equation}
    S(\rho) = \min_{\sigma \in \chi}  D(\rho||\sigma) =-\text{Tr}(\rho_{TLS}\ln({\rho_{TLS}})) = -\text{Tr}(\rho_{QHO}\ln({\rho_{QHO}})),
\end{equation}

where $\chi$ is the set of all the disentangled states.
\\
Wooters states\cite{...} that the Entanglement of Formation (EoF) measures the resources needed to create a given entangled state. He quantifies it in terms of "concurrence", $C$, which ranges from 0 to 1 (0 being no entanglement present, 1 being a maximally entangled state). 

\begin{equation}
    E(C) = h(\frac{1+\sqrt{1-C^2}}{2}),
\end{equation}

where 

\begin{align*}
    h(x) = -x\log_2{x} - (1-x)\log_2{1-x} \\
    C(\rho) = \text{max}\{0,\lambda_1-\lambda_2-\lambda_3-\lambda_4\}
\end{align*}

for the eigenvalues of the matrix $\rho \tilde{\rho}$, where $\tilde{\rho}$ is the spin-flipped density matrix. Since $E$ ranges from 0 to 1 and concurrence does as well, concurrence is effectively a measure of entanglement. A very important point, however, is that Wooters defines concurrence for a pure density matrix of a two-qubit system; our system only contains one qubit (the TLS), and so concurrence does not apply, and further investigation has to be done on a more generalised formulation of concurrence. 
\\
Finally, ER$\alpha$E is a measure of entanglement which provides more information about the entanglement, since it gives a continuous spectrum parametrised by $\alpha$. For a pure density matrix, it is defined by either one of the subsystems.

\begin{equation}
    R_{\alpha}(\Psi) \equiv \frac{1}{1-\alpha}\log_2{\text{Tr}(\rho_B^\alpha)}
\end{equation}

In the $\alpha \to 1$ limit, the ER$\alpha$E reduces to the Von Neumann entropy, which further motivates the generality of the ER$\alpha$E. It would be interesting to look at different choices of $\alpha$ around $1$ and see how the entanglement changes.

\section{Literature Review}
Currently, I have around 15 references which may be used for the literature review. Some give context to the TLS-QHO system, some assist with my preliminary investigations, and the remaining references refer to the different types of entanglement I have been studying. As I progress through the research project, I will undoubtedly gather more references, including ones on coherence and numerical methods. I will aim to have at least 50 references that will be used for the Research Essay.

etc...
