\section*{Week 6 Summary}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Analytical objectives.}
This week I successfully formulated the density matrix for the composite system, and calculated the Von Neumann Entropy and Relative Entropy of Entanglement. The Von Neumann entropy was found to oscillate between 0 and $ln(2)$ (as expected), and the relative entropy of the entanglement was equal to the Von Neumann Entropy of the subsystems for a pure density matrix.

\textbf{Literature Review Structure.}
I created a rough literature review structure which included topics I thought would be relevant to the aims and objectives of the overall project. This structure still, however, needs to be reviewed.

\textbf{Reflection and aims for Week 3.}
I successfully completed 3 objectives (both analytical objectives and the literature review structure. However, as with the previous weeks, much more progress needs to be made with reading papers and generally with the literature review.
