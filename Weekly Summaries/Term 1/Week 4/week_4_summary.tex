\section*{Week 4 Summary}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Analytical objectives.} I successfully defined calculated a revised joint state and diagonalised Hamiltonian in the most general form $|e,n>$ and $|g,n+1>$. I compared it with my previous assumption to confirm this generalised form is correct. 

Furthermore, I calculated the Unitary Evolution of the states for the general Hamiltonian, which was made easier by the diagonalisation. 
    
\textbf{Reflection and aims for Week 3.} Next week, I will look to working out the Von Neumann Entanglement and the Relative Entropy of Entanglement. I will need to start picking up the slack in terms of reading papers.
