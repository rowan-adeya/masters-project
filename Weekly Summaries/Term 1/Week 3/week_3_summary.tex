\section*{Week 3 Summary}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Annotated Bibliography.} I completed the reading of only 1 paper this week, due to being abroad from Wednesday to Monday. However, I read up on a particularly significant paper which goes over the relative entropy of entanglement and the Von Neumann Entropy. I will be using this information in Week 4.

\textbf{Analytical objectives.} I successfully defined calculated a revised joint state and diagonalised Hamiltonian using the following assumptions:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item {$\omega_1=\omega_2$} i.e. resonance. 
        \item The states considered are only $|g,1> and |e,0>$. Generally, the composite system is written as a linear combination of $|e,n>$ and $|g,n+1>$. If I only look at n=1 condition, the analytical calculation simplifies.
    \end{enumerate}
    
\textbf{Reflection and aims for Week 3.} Next week, I will need to look at a more general form of the diagonalized Hamiltonian. My analyses are not vain, however, as I can check my general solution using the assumptions above. Furthermore, I will need to start building up a list of papers to read, including the objectives and intended uses of these sources.
