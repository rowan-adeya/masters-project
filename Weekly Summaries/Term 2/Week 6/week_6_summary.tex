\section*{Week 6 Summary}

\vspace{0.5cm}

During this week, I began working on computationally modelling basic quantum mechanical objects (e.g. bras, kets, Hamiltonians). I began by writing bra and ket classes, and a Hamiltonian class. However, I realised it was a bit more complicated than expected. Thus, I have written a plan to structure the code, which I will execute upon next week.

I have also provided a more detailed literature review outline, which I can use to start writing my literature review.
