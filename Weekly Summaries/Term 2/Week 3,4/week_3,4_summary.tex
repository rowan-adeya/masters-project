\section*{Week 3 and 4 Summary}

\vspace{0.5cm}

Due to illness, little progress was made on week 3. We had a \href{https://github.com/rowan-adeya/masters-project/issues/4}{meeting} on Week 4 where we talked about realigning such that we focus on the literature review, since its deadline is in March. 

Little progress was made on week 4, due to a lack of focus and procrastination. This will have to be made up for in the next week.
