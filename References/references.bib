    annotation  = {This article reviews the Dicke model, an extension and generalisation of the spin-boson model. The authors perform a unitary transformation on the Hamiltonian of the Dicke model, thus splitting it into unperturbed and perturbed parts. This action simplifies the dynamics of the problem and allows the authors to inspect the basis states, where they find that the oscillator contribution to the joint state increases the two-level system's transition energy. Then, perturbation theory is used to determine the system dynamics. The article's latter sections cover developing simpler models to reduce computational loads (including a closely related classical model), and why only one Dicke factor shows up in each perturbation matrix element. This article would be particularly useful in finding ways of simplifying the spin-boson model's Hamiltonian through use of a unitary transformation. Furthermore, it gives an overview of how to describe the dynamics of a system similar to the spin-boson model. Finally, it may provide methods of optimising the computational elements of this project further down the line.}}

The paper goes on to consider the open quantum systems, master equations and computational solutions to the problem. This article has been particularly useful in defining a Hamiltonian for the 2LS coupled to a HO. Later on, it could be particularly useful in providing simplifications and methodologies to open quantum systems and master equations.}

The REE is defined as the minimum distance between the reduced density matrix and the set of all the disentangled density matrices of the system, and it's quantitative definition is given in the paper. The paper concludes that although the interaction terms generate entanglement in an isolated system, entanglement is also generated when the system is in the environemnt.

In the introduction, it importantly states that Entanglement measures are not, in general, the same for a given state (e.g.Entropy of Formation, Relative Entropy of Entanglement), amongst other things. The authors then proceed to state that the ERαE reduces to the Von Neumann entropy for α tending to 1. Afterwards, and most importantly, it defines ERαE, and states that the entanglement of a pure density matrix can be found by calculating ERαE for either of the subsystems. The paper then goes over Wooters conccurence, ERαE for two qubit systems, Werner states and isotropic state ERαE calculations. Whilst Wooters concurrence has relevance, Werner states are not relevant since our system has non-identical Hilbert spaces. Isotropic states can be relevant if we set the Harmonic oscillator to only go up to n=2 (since then the Hilbert spaces will have the same dimensions). The main relevance of this paper is the ERαE for pure states, and the recurrence of the idea of minimisation for mixed states (as seen with the relative entropy of entanglement sources). Wooters' Concurrence should be studied, and once done will unlock more of this paper. Isotropic states can potentially be considered if it helps our understanding of the dynamics of the system.}

He states that for pure bipartite states there is only one accepted measurement of entanglement; for mixed states, there are 3. He then proceeds to talk about different entanglement measures. The Von Neumann entropy is a good measurement for pure states, whereas not for mixed states since mixed states' subsystems can have individually non-zero entropy even if there is no entanglement. He then talks about the entanglement of formation, EoF, (which is designed to pick out the entanglement from the mixed state); the EoF is zero for product states. Furthermore, he discusses distillable entanglement, which measures the pure entanglement one can extract from mixed states. If an entangled state has no distillable entanglement (i.e. no pure entanglement), then it is labelled as bound entanglement; they can have EoF but not pure entanglement. He then proceeds to talk about concurrence, which however at the time of his writing, has a definition only for a pair of qubits. This paper can be quite useful to remind oneself of entanglement generally, and for finding the EoF and concurrence for qubits. However, it is old (2001), and might be outdated. More research will need to be carried out on modern concurrence.}

It turns out that, because we consider the 1-phonon subspace of the Harmonic Oscillator, it can effectively be treated as a qubit, and so we do not need anymore an arbitrary dimensional formulation.

It further notes that the Renyi entropy is relevant in the single shot regime. This paper is a good recent reference for showing that both the Von Neumann and Renyi entropies are still relevant as entanglement measures.}

Furthermore, it includes the use of the Von Neumann entropy, motivating the VNE's importance in Quantum Resource Theory. Moreover, they provide contextual references for the applications of coherence monotones and measures.}

@article{Method2010-TLS-HO_closed,
    author = {Heiko Schröder and Günter Mahler},
    title = {Work exchange between quantum systems: The spin-oscillator model},
    journal = {Phys. Rev. E 81, 021118},
    year = {2010},
    annotation = {Schröder and Mahler look at the emergence of work flux from quantum mechanics. They state that Von Neumann began this work on quantum thermodynamics, and that around 2010 work in this field has received more attention. They begin their analysis by first looking at Time-Dependent driving, and importantly stating two things: (1) If a system is a pure density matrix, its subsystems, generally, will be entangled since there will be interaction between the subsystems; (2) If the purity of the subsystems are close to 1, the dynamics of the total system are well-approximated by that of either of the two subsystems. The paper then moves through different (and irrelevant, in our case) analyses, before looking at the analyses' relevance to the Spin-Oscillator model. It looks at two different types of interaction Hamiltonians, and finds that the dynamics of the system (when applying the RWA) matches that of the Jaynes-Cummings model for one interaction type in the interaction picture. For the second type of interaction, they find that the oscillator acts as an ideal work source within defined limits. This paper provides a thorough worked example for closed quantum dynamics of similar Hamiltonians. It will be a useful reference whilst conducting my own analysis of the Spin-Oscillator model's dynamics, as it outlines a relevant and detailed methodology.}}

It goes over the details of applications of the USC, which however is not very relevant to what we are doing. As mentioned, the key take-away is the comparison of the three models.}
