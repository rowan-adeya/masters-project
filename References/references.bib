@misc{Context_-Spin-boson,
    author       = {Hagelstein P. L., and Chaudhary, I.},
    title        = {Two-level systems coupled to oscillators},
    annotation  = {This article reviews the Dicke model, an extension and generalisation of the spin-boson model. The authors perform a unitary transformation on the Hamiltonian of the Dicke model, thus splitting it into unperturbed and perturbed parts. This action simplifies the dynamics of the problem and allows the authors to inspect the basis states, where they find that the oscillator contribution to the joint state increases the two-level system's transition energy. Then, perturbation theory is used to determine the system dynamics. The article's latter sections cover developing simpler models to reduce computational loads (including a closely related classical model), and why only one Dicke factor shows up in each perturbation matrix element. This article would be particularly useful in finding ways of simplifying the spin-boson model's Hamiltonian through use of a unitary transformation. Furthermore, it gives an overview of how to describe the dynamics of a system similar to the spin-boson model. Finally, it may provide methods of optimising the computational elements of this project further down the line.}

abstract = {Abstract The Jaynes-Cummings model describes the coupling between photons and a single two-level atom in a simplified representation of light-matter interactions. In circuit QED, this model is implemented by combining microwave resonators and superconducting qubits on a microchip with unprecedented experimental control. Arranging qubits and resonators in the form of a lattice realizes a new kind of Hubbard model, the Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model, in which the elementary excitations are polariton quasi-particles. Due to the genuine openness of photonic systems, circuit QED lattices offer the possibility to study the intricate interplay of collective behavior, strong correlations and non-equilibrium physics. Thus, turning circuit QED into an architecture for quantum simulation, i.e., using a well-controlled system to mimic the intricate quantum behavior of another system too daunting for a theorist to tackle head-on, is an exciting idea which has served as theorists’ playground for a while and is now also starting to catch on in experiments. This review gives a summary of the most recent theoretical proposals and experimental efforts.},

In this review, we discuss both optical and electron beam spectroscopies of cavity-coupled material systems in weak, strong, and ultrastrong coupling regimes, providing a theoretical basis for understanding the physics inherent to each while highlighting recent experimental advances and exciting future directions."

abstract = {Abstract The Dicke model describes the coupling between a quantized cavity field and a large ensemble of two-level atoms. When the number of atoms tends to infinity, this model can undergo a transition to a superradiant phase, belonging to the mean-field Ising universality class. The superradiant transition was first predicted for atoms in thermal equilibrium and was recently realized with a quantum simulator made of atoms in an optical cavity, subject to both dissipation and driving. This progress report offers an introduction to some theoretical concepts relevant to the Dicke model, reviewing the critical properties of the superradiant phase transition and the distinction between equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions. In addition, it explains the fundamental difference between the superradiant phase transition and the more common lasing transition. This report mostly focuses on the steady states of atoms in single-mode optical cavities, but it also mentions some aspects of real-time dynamics, as well as other quantum simulators, including superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and using spin–orbit coupling for cold atoms. These realizations differ in regard to whether they describe equilibrium or nonequilibrium systems.},

The author then provides a complete derivation of the Von Neumann entropy using Von Neumann's 'gedanken' (thought experiment); they also provide conditions and assumptions Von Neumann made for the derivation. Finally, the author goes over the influence of the Von Neumann entropy and its use by Shannon in communication theory. This book chapter will be particularly useful as a reference to the simplified calculations of Von Neumann entropy for reduced states, amongst others. It can be used to remind oneself of how exactly this form of entanglement calculation works.}

It then proceeds to prove these conditions. The paper then moves on, saying that for pure, maximally entangled states, REE reduces to the Von Neumann entropy. The authors also prove convexity - entanglement isn't increased by mixing two separate entangled states.

The REE is defined as the minimum distance between the reduced density matrix and the set of all the disentangled density matrices of the system, and it's quantitative definition is given in the paper. The paper concludes that although the interaction terms generate entanglement in an isolated system, entanglement is also generated when the system is in the environemnt.

In the introduction, it importantly states that Entanglement measures are not, in general, the same for a given state (e.g.Entropy of Formation, Relative Entropy of Entanglement), amongst other things. The authors then proceed to state that the ERαE reduces to the Von Neumann entropy for α tending to 1. Afterwards, and most importantly, it defines ERαE, and states that the entanglement of a pure density matrix can be found by calculating ERαE for either of the subsystems. The paper then goes over Wooters conccurence, ERαE for two qubit systems, Werner states and isotropic state ERαE calculations. Whilst Wooters concurrence has relevance, Werner states are not relevant since our system has non-identical Hilbert spaces. Isotropic states can be relevant if we set the Harmonic oscillator to only go up to n=2 (since then the Hilbert spaces will have the same dimensions). The main relevance of this paper is the ERαE for pure states, and the recurrence of the idea of minimisation for mixed states (as seen with the relative entropy of entanglement sources). Wooters' Concurrence should be studied, and once done will unlock more of this paper. Isotropic states can potentially be considered if it helps our understanding of the dynamics of the system.}

He states that for pure bipartite states there is only one accepted measurement of entanglement; for mixed states, there are 3. He then proceeds to talk about different entanglement measures. The Von Neumann entropy is a good measurement for pure states, whereas not for mixed states since mixed states' subsystems can have individually non-zero entropy even if there is no entanglement. He then talks about the entanglement of formation, EoF, (which is designed to pick out the entanglement from the mixed state); the EoF is zero for product states. Furthermore, he discusses distillable entanglement, which measures the pure entanglement one can extract from mixed states. If an entangled state has no distillable entanglement (i.e. no pure entanglement), then it is labelled as bound entanglement; they can have EoF but not pure entanglement. He then proceeds to talk about concurrence, which however at the time of his writing, has a definition only for a pair of qubits. This paper can be quite useful to remind oneself of entanglement generally, and for finding the EoF and concurrence for qubits. However, it is old (2001), and might be outdated. More research will need to be carried out on modern concurrence.}

    annotation = {Schröder and Mahler look at the emergence of work flux from quantum mechanics. They state that Von Neumann began this work on quantum thermodynamics, and that around 2010 work in this field has received more attention. They begin their analysis by first looking at Time-Dependent driving, and importantly stating two things: (1) If a system is a pure density matrix, its subsystems, generally, will be entangled since there will be interaction between the subsystems; (2) If the purity of the subsystems are close to 1, the dynamics of the total system are well-approximated by that of either of the two subsystems. The paper then moves through different (and irrelevant, in our case) analyses, before looking at the analyses' relevance to the Spin-Oscillator model. It looks at two different types of interaction Hamiltonians, and finds that the dynamics of the system (when applying the RWA) matches that of the Jaynes-Cummings model for one interaction type in the interaction picture. For the second type of interaction, they find that the oscillator acts as an ideal work source within defined limits. This paper provides a thorough worked example for closed quantum dynamics of similar Hamiltonians. It will be a useful reference whilst conducting my own analysis of the Spin-Oscillator model's dynamics, as it outlines a relevant and detailed methodology.}}

abstract = {There has been substantial interest of late on the issue of coherence as a resource in quantum thermodynamics. To date, however, analyses have focused on somewhat artificial theoretical models. We seek to bring these ideas closer to experimental investigation by examining the ‘catalytic’ nature of quantum optical coherence. Here the interaction of a coherent state cavity field with a sequence of two-level atoms is considered, a state ubiquitous in quantum optics as a model of a stable, classical source of light. The Jaynes–Cummings interaction Hamiltonian is used, so that an exact solution for the dynamics can be formed, and the evolution of the atomic and cavity states with each atom-field interaction analysed. In this way, the degradation of the coherent state is examined as coherence is transferred to the sequence of atoms. The associated degradation of the coherence in the cavity mode is significant in the context of the use of coherence as a thermodynamic resource.}
