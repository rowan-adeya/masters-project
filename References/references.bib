    title        = {Two-level systems coupled to oscillators},
    annotation  = {This article reviews the Dicke model, an extension and generalisation of the spin-boson model. The authors perform a unitary transformation on the Hamiltonian of the Dicke model, thus splitting it into unperturbed and perturbed parts. This action simplifies the dynamics of the problem and allows the authors to inspect the basis states, where they find that the oscillator contribution to the joint state increases the two-level system's transition energy. Then, perturbation theory is used to determine the system dynamics. The article's latter sections cover developing simpler models to reduce computational loads (including a closely related classical model), and why only one Dicke factor shows up in each perturbation matrix element. This article would be particularly useful in finding ways of simplifying the spin-boson model's Hamiltonian through use of a unitary transformation. Furthermore, it gives an overview of how to describe the dynamics of a system similar to the spin-boson model. Finally, it may provide methods of optimising the computational elements of this project further down the line.}}

    annotation = {This article reviews the damping effect of a 2LS on a Quantum Harmonic Oscillator. It compares the presence of few quanta in the 2LS to fluid friction in classical mechanics, and the presence of many quanta to dry friction, to give context to the reader. The writer then presents the Jaynes-Cummings model of this 2LS coupled to a HO, noting that they equated the frequency of the oscillator to that of the 2LS for simplicity. The paper goes on to consider the open quantum systems, master equations and computational solutions to the problem. This article has been particularly useful in defining a Hamiltonian for the 2LS coupled to a HO. Later on, it could be particularly useful in providing simplifications and methodologies to open quantum systems and master equations.}

    title = {Entanglement in a continuously measured two-level system coupled to a harmonic oscillator},
    journal = {Physical Review Journals},
    year = {2009},
    annotation = {This article looks at non-zero entanglement generation in a TLS coupled to HO system in a zero T Markovian reservoir and probe resonator (measuring device) environment. It looks at the dynamics of the "relative entropy of entanglement" (REE) and finds it is non-zero at a stationary point in the system, if the system is in the environment above. The REE is defined as the minimum distance between the reduced density matrix and the set of all the disentangled density matrices of the system, and it's quantitative definition is given in the paper. The paper concludes that although the interaction terms generate entanglement in an isolated system, entanglement is also generated when the system is in the environemnt. This paper will be particularly useful when I look at open quantum systems and the effect of the environment on the system, and in particular gives me a way to quantify entanglement through its definition as the REE.}

    title = {Quantifying Entanglement},
    journal = {Physical Review Journals},
    year = {1997},
    annotation = {This paper provides a completely general expression for entanglement. It goes over purification methods (not well defined) and suggests that there is no unique measure of entanglement. The paper then proposes 3 conditions: (i) Entanglement is 0 if product state; (ii) Unitary operations do not change entanglement; (iii) Entanglement cannot increase under measurement. It then proceeds to prove these conditions. The paper then moves on, saying that for pure, maximally entangled states, REE reduces to the Von Neumann entropy. The authors also prove convexity - entanglement isn't increased by mixing two separate entangled states. Overall, this paper gives a solid overview of the field of entanglement, and the conditions for entanglement.}

    annotation = {This chapter of the book summarises entropy, derives the Von Neumann entropy and goes over developements of the Von Neumann entropy. It begins first by outling the history of entropy, and going over the second law of Thermodynamics (including Boltzmann's contribution). The author then provides a complete derivation of the Von Neumann entropy using Von Neumann's 'gedanken' (thought experiment); they also provide conditions and assumptions Von Neumann made for the derivation. Finally, the author goes over the influence of the Von Neumann entropy and its use by Shannon in communication theory. This book chapter will be particularly useful as a reference to the simplified calculations of Von Neumann entropy for reduced states, amongst others. It can be used to remind oneself of how exactly this form of entanglement calculation works.}
