\section*{Week 2 Summary}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{Annotated Bibliography.} I completed the reading of only 1 paper this week, due to time constraints with other deadlines. Whilst this objective was incomplete, I still managed to obtain at least 2 reference leads.

\textbf{Analytical objectives.} I successfully defined a Hamiltonian for the 2LS coupled to a QHO. I also defined a general joint basis, from which I made two calculations:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 2LS state with only one QHO state. This calculation was trivial since it did not include the interaction part of the Hamiltonian. Thus, I successfully diagonalized the Hamiltonian matrix. It will be useful later on, since now that I have the trivial matrix I can add on interaction Hamiltonians.
    \item 2LS state with 2 QHO states. This calculation led to a 4x4 matrix, and even after simplifying was difficult to do analytically, and was better done computationally.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Reflection and aims for Week 3.} Next week, I shall find simplifications which allow me to analytically diagonalize a Hamiltonian matrix which includes interactions. Furthermore, I did not complete writing up the literature review structure and so this will have to be done as well. Finally, more papers will need to be read more consistently.
