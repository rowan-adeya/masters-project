This git repository will contain most (if not all) of the documents for my MSc Physics Project. 

I will be editing .tex files within Overleaf and pushing them to the Git repository; it is important that at the end of every work session, the main branch is updated to the current version (i.e. maintain version control).

The two systems this project will be located on are my home PC and my laptop.

##### STRUCTURE SUMMARY 

The "Additional Resources" folder will contain miscallaneous items which will help in the project, such as examples of other work.

The "Important Document" folder will contain current working versions and final versions of "important documents"; these include literature review, outlines, guidlines and the final paper. 

The "References" folder will contain a a full annotated bibliography, with a .bib file which will contain all the references themselves. The subfolder "reference_files_pdfs" will contain most of the papers that I will be reading. 

The "Learning Resources" folder will contain items such as textbooks, articles and links which will directly aid in my continued learning. 

The "References" folder will contain a a full annotated bibliography, with a .bib file which will contain all the references themselves. The subfolder "reference_files_pdfs" will contain most of the papers that I will be reading. 

Weekly directories will be created, whereby the main objectives, working out and analysis, notes and summaries of work will be present.
